## TeachTrack

The app is designed to help teachers keep track of their students' progress. It allows teachers to create classes, add students to those classes, and add assignments to those classes. Teachers can then add grades to those assignments for each student. The app also allows teachers to view the average grade for each assignment and the average grade for each student. AI will be implemented to help teachers predict which students are at risk of failing a class and give them suggestions on how to help those students.
